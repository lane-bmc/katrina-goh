        <p>Here are a few things you need to know and remember about the night:</p>

        <section id="rules">
          <h2>Sign up!</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>To ensure a good amount of playing time and fun for everyone, we need to make sure that people sign up and we know how many players there will be. There are a limited number of spots, so please <strong>sign up</strong>!</p>
          <a class="button" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxmsytFQRfaS5OjMoJQHcpagfkGGZeuJZ3_uO_9tgGTZphdA/viewform">Sign Up!</a>

          <h2>Bring $5!</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Because we're renting out a community centre gymnasium this time, please bring $5 to help cover the cost of the rental and rental insurance.</p>

          <h2>Arrive early!</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Our 8:30-10:30pm time slot includes setup and cleanup. In order to maximize our time and have things move smoothly, please arrive early - come at 8:15 if you can!</p>

          <h2>Bring protective gear!</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>We recommend at least some knee pads and gloves, but bring whatever you think you'll need to stay safe. It's all for fun, so we don't want any injuries!</p>

          <h2>No slapshots!</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>For the safety of everyone involved, there will be no wind-up slapshots. Keep your stick below your waist at all times - there are other people playing too!</p>

          <h2>Plastic blades please!</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>If you plan to bring your own stick, great! (If you can't, don't worry - just let us know in the sign-up form and we'll try to bring one for you). Please bring a <strong>plastic-bladed stick</strong> if you can, and if you must bring a wooden-bladed stick, then please <strong>remove any tape and tape residue on the blade</strong>. We don't want to mark up their floors!</p>

          <h2>Stay hydrated!</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Bring water and drink regularly!</p>

          <h2>Have fun!</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Get to know some people in your church family that you might not know too well, and have fun and fellowship with one another through a great night of hockey!</p>
        </section>

        <p>If that all sounds good to you, then let's play together!</p>
